## Exclusions

### Excluding participants who did not complete our IV and/or DV

```{r ivdv.excl, include = FALSE}
# Excluding those missing Bitcoin allocation (DV)
cflorig.alloexcl <- cflorig[ which(is.na(cflorig$allo) == FALSE ) , ]

# Excluding those missing prevention (one of two IVs)
cflorig.prevexcl <- cflorig.alloexcl[ which(is.na(cflorig.alloexcl$prev) == FALSE ) , ]

cflorig.ivdvexcl.n <- 500 - nrow(cflorig.prevexcl)
```

As per our pre-defined exclusion criteria, `r cflorig.ivdvexcl.n` participants were excluded for not submitting a Bitcoin allocation percentage (our dependent measure) or completing the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire ("RFQ"), which was used to calculate chronic prevention pride scores (one of our two independent measures).

### Deciding whether to exclude participants with fraudulent IP addresses

Soon after running this study, it became clear that data quality issues had recently surfaced on M-Turk due to foreign workers masking their location through Virtual Private Servers [see, for example, @dennisetal2018; @kennedyetal2018]. As a result, although not specified in our preregistration, we decided to consider excluding participants for data quality issues resulting from fraudulent IP addresses based on an investigation of the reliability of these responses.

```{r ip, include = FALSE}
cflexcl <- cflorig.prevexcl
# blockornot <- getIPinfo(cflexcl1, "IPAddress", "[key]")
# Anyone looking to rerun the line of code above will need to secure a free X-key
# from iphub.info and place it within the quotes

# blockornot <- rename(blockornot, IPAddress = ip)
cflexcl <- merge(cflexcl, blockornot, by = "IPAddress") # Merging blockornot results

## Determining participants flagged as block = (1 or 2) vs. 1 only
cflexcl$block12 <- ifelse(cflexcl$block == "0", 0, 1)
cflexcl$block <- as.numeric(cflexcl$block)
cflexcl$block.d <- ifelse(cflexcl$block == 1, 1, 0)

blocked1s <- nrow(subset(cflexcl, block.d == 1)) # 147 1's
blocked12s <- nrow(subset(cflexcl, block12 == 1)) # 151 1's and 2's
```

We examined our dataset for fraudulent responses based on users' IP addresses using `r cite_r("manuscript/rfcfloss.bib", pkgs = c("rIP"), withhold = FALSE)`. This package returns the dataset with a "block" column including a coded score indicating if the IP address is likely from a server farm and warrants exclusion. In doing so, we discovered `r blocked1s` participants who met this criterion and received an *rIP* "block" score of 1. (We selected the less stringent of the two "block" scores within the *rIP* package to minimize exclusions, but the following findings are consistent regardless of which "block" score was used.) We then probed these purportedly fraudulent responses to determine if their quality differed substantially from the rest of our sample.

```{r iptest.alpha, include = FALSE}
# Cronbach alpha when blocking 1s only
cflexcl.a <- select(cflexcl, rfq_2r, rfq_4r, rfq_5, rfq_6r, rfq_8r, block.d)
cflexcl.a.noblock <- subset(cflexcl.a, block.d == 0) # n = 334
cflexcl.a.noblock$block.d <- NULL # Removing column so I can calculate Cronbach's alpha below
cflexcl.a.block <- subset(cflexcl.a, block.d == 1) # n = 147
cflexcl.a.block$block.d <- NULL # Removing column so I can calculate Cronbach's alpha below

a.noblock <- psych::alpha(cflexcl.a.noblock)$total$std.alpha # Cronbach's alpha of unblocked group = 0.86
a.block <- psych::alpha(cflexcl.a.block)$total$std.alpha # Cronbach's alpha of blocked group = 0.55
feldttest <- cocron.two.coefficients(alpha = c(a.noblock,a.block), n = c(nrow(cflexcl.a.noblock),nrow(cflexcl.a.block)), dep = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided") # Significantly lower Cronbach's alpha in blocked group (p < .001)
```

First, we examined internal reliability. In previous research, Higgins and colleagues [-@higginsetal2001] found that the reliability of the prevention scale was 0.80, and among participants who did *not* receive a block score of 1, the Cronbach's alpha of the prevention items was in line with this estimate ($\alpha = `r myround(a.noblock, digits = 2)`$). However, among the responses who received a block score of 1 (thus indicating fraudulence), the Cronbach's alpha of the prevention items was `r myround(a.block, digits = 2)`. In particular, this reduced reliability appeared to be driven by reverse-coded items, as among this group, the function produced a warning message prompting us to confirm that the reverse-coded items were coded correctly (which we confirmed). To be clear, participants flagged as fraudulent did not respond to reverse-coded items as if they were reverse-coded, whereas other participants did. Following a method by Feldt et al. [-@feldtetal1987] to determine the equality of two Cronbach's alphas in which the statistic *W* is distributed as *F*, we also used the R-package *cocron* [Version 1.0.1; @R-cocron] to perform a statistical comparison of these two reliabilities. We found that the chronic prevention pride scores among participants flagged as fraudulent were significantly less reliable than non-flagged participants' scores, $W(`r feldttest@df[1]`, `r feldttest@df[2]`) = `r myround(feldttest@statistic, digits = 2)`, p < .001$.

```{r iptest.var, include = FALSE}
# Variance when blocking 1s only
varblocked <- mean(cflexcl$prev.var[cflexcl$block == 1], na.rm = TRUE) # average prev var = 0.951
varunblocked <- mean(cflexcl$prev.var[cflexcl$block != 1], na.rm = TRUE) # average prev var = 0.609
```

```{r iptest.var.test, include = FALSE}
vartest <- t.test(prev.var ~ block.d, data = cflexcl)
```

```{r iptest.var.output, include = FALSE}
cflexcl.blocked <- cflexcl[cflexcl$block.d == 0,] # Blocking flagged as "1"; n = 334
cflexcl.blocked.usonly <- cflexcl.blocked[cflexcl.blocked$countryCode == "US",] # n = 301
cfl.ipexcl <- cflexcl.blocked.usonly
cfl <- cflexcl.blocked.usonly
cfl.postip <- nrow(cfl)
cfl.excludedbyip <- nrow(cflexcl) - cfl.postip
```

Additionally, we examined the variance of responses to prevention-specific items from the RFQ. The variance across prevention items in the RFQ was also significantly greater among participants in the potentially fraudulent group (`r myround(varblocked, digits = 2)`) than among the non-flagged participant group (`r myround(varunblocked, digits = 2)`), $t(`r myround(vartest[["parameter"]], digits = 2)`) = `r myround(vartest[["statistic"]], digits = 2)`, p < .001$.

As a result, we excluded all participants with a "block" score of 1. (We selected the less stringent of the two "block" scores within the package to minimize exclusions, but the following findings are consistent regardless of which "block" score was used.) We also excluded all participants whose IP addresses revealed they were not located in the United States, which was required for all participants.

### Deciding whether to exclude participants who had not previously invested in Bitcoin

Among the remaining participants, we noted in our preregistration that if less than 10% of our sample comprises participants who report previously investing in Bitcoin, then we would exclude all participants who previously invested in Bitcoin (as this group might be expected to respond differently to our experimental manipulation); if 10% or more of our data is made of participants who previously invested in Bitcoin, then we will also conduct our analyses both including and excluding those participants, and will report any differences that emerge.

```{r subset1, include=FALSE}
cfl.noprevinv <- subset(cfl, previnvested != 1)
cfl.noprevinv.pct <- myround((nrow(cfl.ipexcl)-nrow(cfl.noprevinv))/nrow(cfl.ipexcl) * 100, digits = 2)
```

`r cfl.noprevinv.pct`% previously invested in Bitcoin (more than 10%), so we *did not* proceed with exclusion.

### Deciding whether to exclude those who learned about the study from other participants

Similarly, we noted in our preregistration that if less than 10% of our sample is composed of participants who report being told details about the beta-test or the DigiVest platform from another participant, then we will exclude these participants. 

```{r subset2, include=FALSE}
cfl.didntlearn <- subset(cfl, told_test != 1)
cfl.didntlearn.pct <- myround((nrow(cfl.ipexcl)-nrow(cfl.didntlearn))/nrow(cfl.ipexcl) * 100, digits = 2)
```

Only `r cfl.didntlearn.pct`% of our sample reported learning about the study from other participants (less than 10%), so we *did* proceed with exclusion. As described in our preregistration, we also reran our primary analyses without this exclusion to confirm that our findings were consistent (see final section of this Supplementary Materials document).

### Redefining dataset to reflect exclusions (per pre-registration; to be edited if either excluded group is >10%)

```{r subset3, include=FALSE}

## Final Sample

Our final dataset includes observations from these `r n` M-Turk participants. The sample had a mean age of `r myround(meanage, digits = 2)` years ($SD = `r myround(sdage, digits = 2)`$, ranging from `r minage` to `r maxage`) and were `r malepct`% male and `r femalepct`% female. `r engpct`% of participants ($n = `r english`$) reported English as their native language. The ethnic breakdown in order of size was white ($n = `r white`$, `r whitepct`%), black ($n = `r black`$, `r blackpct`%), Asian ($n = `r asian`$, `r asianpct`%), and Hispanic ($n = `r hisp`$, `r hisppct`%). The income breakdown in order of size was \$70K - \$100K ($n = `r seventyhundred`$, `r seventyhundredpct`%), \$40K - \$70K ($n = `r fortyseventy`$, `r fortyseventypct`%), \$100K - \$250K ($n = `r hundredtwofifty`$, `r hundredtwofiftypct`%), \$20K - \$40K ($n = `r twentyforty`$, `r twentyfortypct`%), \$250K - \$500K ($n = `r twofiftyfive`$, `r twofiftyfivepct`%), \$10K - \$20K ($n = `r tentwenty`$, `r tentwentypct`%), and \$500K+ ($n = `r fiveplus`$, `r fivepluspct`%). The highest level of education participants reported attaining in order of size was a graduate degree ($n = `r graddegree`$, `r graddegreepct`%), an associate's degree ($n = `r associates`$, `r associatespct`%), some college ($n = `r somecollege`$, `r somecollegepct`%), a bachelor's degree ($n = `r bachelors`$, `r bachelorspct`%), a doctorate ($n = `r doctorate`$, `r doctoratepct`%), and a high school diploma ($n = `r highschool`$, `r highschoolpct`%). Histogram plots for each of these demographic measures are included below.

# Primary Linear Analyses

## Hypothesized Model

As described in the article, we were primarily interested in examining if participants' chronic prevention pride interacted with counterfactual loss to predict allocation of one's funds toward a risky investment in Bitcoin. To test our hypothesis, we entered these predictors into a linear regression analysis, the results of which are presented in Table 1. To supplement these results, a visualization of the model's predictions is presented in the following figure. Additionally, we built an application to dynamically generate model predictions using `r cite_r("manuscript/rfcfloss.bib", pkgs = "shiny", withhold = FALSE)`. The application is located online at http://regfocusrisk.com ([Anonymous], 2019).

The results revealed no main effects of any single predictor. However, as predicted, the analysis yielded a significant two-way interaction between prevention pride and counterfactual loss condition ($B = `r myround(as.numeric(table1[4,"Estimate"]), digits = 2)`, t(`r df`) = `r myround(as.numeric(table1[4,"t"]), digits = 2)`, `r pval(as.numeric(table1[4,"p"]))`$).

As described in the article, the interaction between prevention pride and counterfactual loss remained significant when *not* including promotion pride in the model, as well as when controlling for a range of demographic variables. Tables 2-8 contain the results of these analyses.

When we control for promotion pride and the interaction between promotion and counterfactual loss, the interaction between prevention pride and counterfactual loss was only *marginally* associated with the degree to which participants reported they missed out by not investing in Bitcoin earlier ($\beta = `r myround(a3.missedout.promctr, digits = 2)`$, $p = `r myround(a3.p.missedout.promctr, digits = 3)`$), while the effect of participants reporting they missed out by not investing earlier ($\beta = `r myround(b.missedout.promctr, digits = 2)`$, $`r pval(as.numeric(b.p.missedout.promctr))`$) on Bitcoin allocation was significant. (See Table 9 for full model output.)

Given the marginal significance of the a path, we concluded that our interaction of interest is not mediated by missing out.

The interaction between prevention and counterfactual loss was not significantly associated with the degree to which participants reported they imagine they would be happier if they had invested in Bitcoin earlier (n.s.), so we concluded that our interaction of interest is not mediated by hypothetical happiness.

When we control for promotion pride and the interaction between promotion and counterfactual loss, the interaction between prevention and counterfactual loss was significantly associated with the degree to which participants reported they imagine they would be relieved if they had invested in Bitcoin earlier ($\beta = `r myround(a3.relieved.promctr, digits = 2)`$, $`r pval(as.numeric(a3.p.relieved.promctr))`$), and the effect of participants reporting they imagined being relieved if they had invested earlier ($\beta = `r myround(b.relieved.promctr, digits = 2)`$, $`r pval(as.numeric(b.p.relieved.promctr))`$) on Bitcoin allocation was also significant.

When rerunning our simple slopes and Johnson-Neyman analyses, the direction and significance of our results do not change. The effect of prevention pride on Bitcoin allocation was still significant in the counterfactual loss condition ($B = `r myround(jn1.rerun[1,"estimate"], digits = 2)`, SE = `r myround(jn1.rerun[1,"std.error"], digits = 2)`, t = `r myround(jn1.rerun[1,"statistic"], digits = 2)`, `r pval(as.numeric(jn1.rerun[1,"p.value"]))`$; 95% CI [`r myround(jn1.rerun[1,"conf.low"], digits = 4)`, `r myround(jn1.rerun[1,"conf.high"], digits = 4)`]) but non-significant in the control condition.

Further, the conditional effect of counterfactual loss on Bitcoin allocation was still positive for people with prevention pride of less than 2.51 ($B = `r myround(jn2.rerun[3,"estimate"], digits = 2)`, SE = `r myround(jn2.rerun[3,"std.error"], digits = 2)`, t = `r myround(jn2.rerun[3,"statistic"], digits = 2)`, `r pval(as.numeric(jn2.rerun[3,"p.value"]))`$), and negative for people with prevention pride of greater than 4.57 ($B = `r myround(jn2.rerun[1,"estimate"], digits = 2)`, SE = `r myround(jn2.rerun[1,"std.error"], digits = 2)`, t = `r myround(jn2.rerun[1,"statistic"], digits = 2)`, `r pval(as.numeric(jn2.rerun[1,"p.value"]))`$).

When we control for promotion pride and the interaction between promotion and counterfactual loss, the interaction between prevention and counterfactual loss was still significantly associated with the degree to which participants reported they would be relieved if they had invested in Bitcoin earlier ($\beta = `r myround(a3.relieved.promctr.rerun, digits = 2)`$, $`r pval(as.numeric(a3.p.relieved.promctr.rerun))`$), and the effect of participants reporting they would be relieved if they had invested earlier ($\beta = `r myround(b.relieved.promctr.rerun, digits = 2)`$, $`r pval(as.numeric(b.p.relieved.promctr.rerun))`$) on Bitcoin allocation was also significant.

The indirect effect of prevention on Bitcoin allocation through reporting relief if they had invested earlier was significant and negative for individuals in the counterfactual loss condition ($\beta = `r myround(condIndEffCFL.relieved.promctr.rerun, digits = 2)`$, $SE = `r myround(condIndEffCFL.se.relieved.promctr.rerun, digits = 2)`$, 95% $CI = `r myround(condIndEffCFL.cilower.relieved.promctr.rerun, digits = 4)`, `r myround(condIndEffCFL.ciupper.relieved.promctr.rerun, digits = 4)`$), but not for individuals in the control condition (n.s.). This indicates that the moderation is still fully mediated.
